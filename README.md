#### Hello, my name is Stanislav.
Here is some facts about me:
- I'm software developer for many years but I still like it.
- Also I'm interesting in photography not with cell phone but with a real camera.
- Also I'm interesting in all about microcontrollers but without any *\*.ino* (don't start it, pls).
- Also I'm interesting in travelling arount the place I live in and know interesting things about all this miracles.
- Some of my recent projects descriptions are [here](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/README.md)

My current practical experiments with microcontrollers looks like this:<br>

I make my [first steps](https://github.com/K-S-K/ESP32-02-OLedCounter/blob/master/docs/Ch01_LostBits.md) in this direction but I believe it will be big and interessting journey.
