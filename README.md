## Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!
Here are some facts about me:
- I've been a software developer for many years but I still like it.
- Also, I'm interested in photography, not with a cell phone but with a real camera.
- Also, I'm interested in all about microcontrollers but without any *\*.ino* (don't start it, please).
- Also, I'm interested in traveling around where I live and learning interesting things about all these miracles.
- Some of the descriptions of my past projects are [here](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/README.md#project-gallery)
- Right now, I have a fantastic job. I'm working on the spacecraft attitude control model for the future mission. It is very exciting to work for the future of our civilization.


## My last projects are:
### In 2024, I started a couple of new projects:
#### Cross Docker Container Distributed system Example
This [project](https://github.com/K-S-K/CCCS), written in C++, aims to develop an approach to **communicating between applications** in docker containers and allowing them to **exchange binary serialized messages** via sockets. The project can be a source of examples for creating more complex projects.

#### Cross Docker Container Signal Exchange.
The purpose of this [project](https://github.com/K-S-K/CCSS) written in **C++** is to adjust the approach of creating several projects in **different docker containers** and let them **communicate via sockets**. The project can be used as a template for creating more complex projects.

### In 2023, I've made several projects, here are some of them:
#### Prototype Board CAD
A simple editor for prototype board wiring planning with effective storage files in a version-management-friendly format.<be>
The project is written in C# for use in a web environment. 

It contains:
- Domain area library with a prototype board model.
- Minimal API web application.
- Blazor Web site application.

Other properties:
- It is written on C#, with .Net 7.
- It can be built and works on Windows and Linux OS.
- It contains GitHub actions, which deploys it to the AWS.

#### LCD Screen driver for ESP Microcontroller:<br>

I make my [first steps](https://github.com/K-S-K/ESP32-02-OLed-SSD1366/blob/master/docs/Ch01_LostBits.md) in this direction, but I believe it will be a big and interesting journey.
