### Hello, my name is Stanislav.
Here are some facts about me:
- I've been a software developer for many years but I still like it.
- Also I'm interested in photography not with a cell phone but with a real camera.
- Also I'm interested in all about microcontrollers but without any *\*.ino* (don't start it, pls).
- Also I'm interested in traveling around the place I live in and knowing interesting things about all these miracles.
- Some of the descriptions of my recent projects are [here](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/README.md)

#### Just started a new project.
A simple editor for breadboard wiring planning with effective storage files in a version-management-friendly format.<br>

#### My recent practical experiments with microcontrollers look like this:<br>

I make my [first steps](https://github.com/K-S-K/ESP32-02-OLed-SSD1366/blob/master/docs/Ch01_LostBits.md) in this direction but I believe it will be a big and interesting journey.
