### Hello, my name is Stanislav.
Here are some facts about me:
- I've been a software developer for many years but still like it.
- Also, I'm interested in photography, not with a cell phone but with a real camera.
- Also, I'm interested in all about microcontrollers but without any *\*.ino* (don't start it, please).
- Also, I'm interested in traveling around where I live and learning interesting things about all these miracles.
- Some of the descriptions of my recent projects are [here](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/README.md#project-gallery)

#### Just started a new project - Cross Container Signal Exchange.
The purpose of this [project](https://github.com/K-S-K/CCSS) is to adjust the approach of creating several projects in different docker containers and let them communicate with each other via sockets. The project can be used as a template for creating more complex projects.

#### In 2023, I started a new project.
A simple editor for prototype board wiring planning with effective storage files in a version-management-friendly format.<br>

#### My recent practical experiments with microcontrollers look like this:<br>

I make my [first steps](https://github.com/K-S-K/ESP32-02-OLed-SSD1366/blob/master/docs/Ch01_LostBits.md) in this direction but I believe it will be a big and interesting journey.
