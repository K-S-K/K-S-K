## Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!
Here are some facts about me:
- I've been a software developer for many years, but I still like it.
- Also, I'm interested in photography, not with a cell phone but with a real camera.
- Also, I'm interested in all about microcontrollers, but without any *\*.ino* (don't start it, please).
- Also, I'm interested in traveling around where I live and learning interesting things about all these miracles.
- You can see the **[gallery of my projects](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/README.md#project-gallery)** with brief descriptions of every one of them.
- Right now, I have a fantastic job. I'm working on the spacecraft attitude control model for the next version of the Gaia telescope. It is very exciting to work with incredible people for the sake of the future of our civilization.

## My actual doing:

- Software development in C# (14);
- Development of the software running on Linux-based platforms;
- [Development of the spacecraft Attitude and Orbit Control System model](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/Articles/36_GaiaSDT/Article.md) (at work);
- Learning embedded schematics and software development - FreeRTOS, Raspberry PI Pico (at home).

## Some of my recent projects are:


### [2025. The FreeRTOS-based timer working on RP2350](https://github.com/K-S-K/Pico-Timer-2)

Through this project, I gained experience with FreeRTOS and embedded development. I've also had a lot of fun working on this project because I genuinely enjoy it.

### [2024-... The modeling of the Gaia telescope Attitude and Orbit Control System](Articles/36_GaiaSDT/Article.md)

During my current job, I touched amazing things that are significantly bigger than I could have ever imagined. The picture and brief description of the project are inside the article.

### In 2023, I've made several projects; here are some of them:
#### [Prototype Board CAD](https://github.com/K-S-K/CV/blob/main/Articles/30_BBCAD/Article.md)
A simple editor for prototype board wiring planning with effective storage files in a version-management-friendly format.<be>
The project is written in C# for use in a web environment. 

It contains:
- Domain area library with a prototype board model.
- Minimal API web application.
- Blazor Web site application.

Other properties:
- It is written in C#, with .NET 7.
- It can be built and works on Windows and Linux OS.
- It contains GitHub actions, which deploy it to AWS.

I make my [first steps](https://github.com/K-S-K/ESP32-02-OLed-SSD1366/blob/master/docs/Ch01_LostBits.md) in this direction, but I believe it will be a big and enjoyable journey.
